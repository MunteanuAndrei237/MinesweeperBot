# minesweeperBot
Once you run the program , make sure the whole game box is visible on the screen , then you can press P to start the bot, or C to stop the program .
It has a very trivial approach and works only 60% of the time , but I will fix it soon 
You can modify the mouse speed and pause speed at the beggining of the code
