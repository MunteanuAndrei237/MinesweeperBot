# minesweeperBot
Once you run the program , make sure the whole game box is visible on the screen , then you can press P to start the bot, or C to stop the program .
It has a very trivial approach and works only 60% of the time , but I will fix it soon 
You can modify the mouse speed and pause time at the beggining of the code 
In the video there is an example of how the bot works (with 0.1 mouse speed and 5 sec pause time between loops)( recorded using OBS)
