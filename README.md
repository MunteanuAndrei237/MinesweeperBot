# minesweeperBot
Once you run the program , make sure the whole game box is visible on the screen , then you can press P to start the bot, or C to stop the program .
It works 90% of the time, but if he cannot progress anymore using a trivial approach(looking for number and bombs and flags around) it uses a backtracking algorithm which can take up to 10 minutes (depending on how long the chain of unsolved squares he finds)
You can modify the mouse speed and pause time at the beggining of the code 
In the video there is an example of how the bot works (with 0.1 mouse speed and 0.1 sec pause time between loops)( recorded using OBS)
